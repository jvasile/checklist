Checklists FTW
==============

These days, every humanitarian or policy intervention includes a tech
component.  Sometimes, this inclusion raises an obvious need for
review by a technologist.  For example, the intervention might require
secure communication and storage of sensitive data from an at-risk
population.  Other times, the need might be more subtle.  For example,
anonymized private medical data might be exposed in ways that allow
individual identities to be inferred.

Most of the program officers and many of the PIs who work on such
interventions are experts in their chosen domain.  We cannot demand
they also become expert technologists.  This project's aim is to
support program officers in identifying technology issues that should
prompt consultation with knowledgable peers or technologists.

We would like to see a range of checklists that guide a user through
spotting issues and then help them find resources for consultation.
We have provided an initial example around information security, but
it is just an example.  We expect orgs to make their own checklists
and hope they will contribute them back to the common pool to serve as
examples for peer orgs.

So take a look and get in touch!  This is still very raw material, and
we are eager to see evolution around content of checklists,
process for applying them, and providing expert consultation when the
checklists identify the need.
